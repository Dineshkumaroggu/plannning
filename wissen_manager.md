---

### ‚úÖ 11. **What challenges did you face recently in the project?**

**Answer:**
"Recently, we faced an issue where one of our microservices was taking longer to respond due to a heavy join query. It affected user-facing APIs. I profiled the query, optimized it by introducing proper indexing, and also added a Redis cache for repeat queries. This improved the API response time by over 40%. We also added monitoring alerts to catch similar issues early."

---

### ‚úÖ 12. **How did you resolve production issues?**

**Answer:**
"When a production issue arises, we follow a structured approach:

1. Analyze logs from ELK stack or CloudWatch.
2. Reproduce the issue in a lower environment if possible.
3. Apply hotfixes only after root cause analysis.
4. Write regression test cases to prevent recurrence.
5. Document the RCA and share it with the team.
   In one recent incident, we resolved a memory leak by analyzing heap dumps and fixing improper object references in a scheduled job."

---

### ‚úÖ 13. **How do you work in a team setup? Agile methodology specifics?**

**Answer:**
"We follow Agile with 2-week sprints. Every day, we have stand-ups, sprint planning at the start, and retrospectives at the end. I work closely with QA, BA, and frontend teams to understand requirements and deliver in increments. We track tasks in Jira and follow a pull-request review process before merging any code to the main branch."

---

### ‚úÖ 14. **Explain how you implemented asynchronous programming in your project.**

**Answer:**
"In one of our use cases, we needed to process customer notifications in bulk. Instead of doing it synchronously, which would slow down the response time, we used Kafka. When the request is received, we publish a message to a Kafka topic, and a consumer processes the messages independently. This approach made the system faster and more fault-tolerant."

---

### ‚úÖ 15. **How do you ensure secure coding? How do you handle vulnerabilities?**

**Answer:**
"We follow secure coding practices like input validation, using prepared statements to avoid SQL injection, and encrypting sensitive data. We use tools like SonarQube for static code analysis and OWASP dependency-check to identify known vulnerabilities. Regular code reviews and security testing are part of our CI pipeline."

---

### ‚úÖ 16. **Explain how you implemented authentication and authorization (Auth vs Authz).**

**Answer:**
"We use JWT tokens for authentication. Once a user logs in, the token is generated and passed in the headers for subsequent API calls. Spring Security validates the token and grants access. For authorization, we implement role-based access control (RBAC) using annotations like `@PreAuthorize` and custom filters to restrict certain endpoints based on roles."

---

## üîπ **Section 3: Process & Methodology**

---

### ‚úÖ 17. **Explain Agile methodology.**

**Answer:**
"Agile is an iterative development methodology that promotes collaboration, flexibility, and customer feedback. In Agile, the work is divided into small increments called sprints, typically lasting 2 weeks. We have regular ceremonies like daily stand-ups, sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives. Agile helps deliver features incrementally, get quick feedback, and adapt to changes efficiently."

---

### ‚úÖ 18. **Explain SDLC and where your role fits in it.**

**Answer:**
"SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It includes phases like:

1. **Requirement gathering**
2. **Design**
3. **Development**
4. **Testing**
5. **Deployment**
6. **Maintenance**

As a backend developer, my main involvement is in the **design, development, and testing phases**. I analyze requirements, contribute to system design (like API contracts and service interactions), write clean and testable code, perform unit/integration testing, and support deployment and production monitoring."

---

### ‚úÖ 19. **What ceremonies do you participate in during Agile development?**

**Answer:**
"I actively participate in:

* **Daily Stand-ups:** Quick updates on what I did, what I‚Äôll do, and any blockers.
* **Sprint Planning:** To estimate stories and break them into tasks.
* **Sprint Reviews:** To demonstrate completed work to stakeholders.
* **Retrospectives:** To discuss what went well, what didn‚Äôt, and how we can improve.
  I also engage in backlog grooming and estimation sessions with the team."

---

### ‚úÖ 20. **How do you estimate and plan your tasks in Agile?**

**Answer:**
"We estimate tasks using **story points** during sprint planning. For better accuracy, we use techniques like **Planning Poker**. I break down user stories into small, manageable sub-tasks and consider development, testing, and review time. I communicate early if a task is at risk and re-prioritize based on team discussions and sprint goals."

---

## üîπ **Section 4: Scenario-Based and Deep Technical Questions**

---

### ‚úÖ 21. **How do you debug and resolve a production issue? Give an example.**

**Answer:**
"When a production issue is reported, I first check logs using tools like ELK or CloudWatch to trace the root cause. If logs are insufficient, I look at metrics (CPU, memory, DB latency).
For example, once a scheduled job failed silently due to an uncaught exception. I added proper logging, handled the exception, and created an alert so that similar failures don‚Äôt go unnoticed again. We also do an RCA (root cause analysis) and document it for future prevention."

---

### ‚úÖ 22. **How do you handle API failures or service downtime in microservices?**

**Answer:**
"We use **circuit breakers** (like Resilience4j) to prevent cascading failures.
For example, if a downstream service fails, the circuit breaker temporarily opens the circuit to avoid repeated requests.
We also implement **retry logic**, **timeouts**, and **fallback methods** to ensure graceful degradation.
Additionally, we log failures and send alerts through monitoring tools like Prometheus + Grafana."

---

### ‚úÖ 23. **How do you ensure high availability and scalability in your services?**

**Answer:**

* **Horizontal Scaling:** Deploying multiple instances behind a load balancer.
* **Stateless Design:** So services can scale easily.
* **Caching:** Using Redis to reduce DB hits.
* **Asynchronous Processing:** Offload heavy work via Kafka.
* **Health Checks & Auto-restart:** Using Docker/Kubernetes.
* **Monitoring:** Continuously observe CPU, memory, latency, and error rates.

---

### ‚úÖ 24. **What are the key vulnerabilities in a Java backend app and how do you prevent them?**

**Answer:**
Common vulnerabilities include:

* **SQL Injection:** Prevented using prepared statements.
* **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** Avoided by escaping outputs.
* **CSRF:** Protected via Spring Security tokens.
* **Broken Authentication:** Avoid storing plain tokens, always encrypt.
* **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Store credentials in vaults, encrypt data at rest and transit.

We run **SonarQube**, **OWASP Dependency Check**, and do manual code reviews to catch these early.

---

### ‚úÖ 25. **What tools do you use for code quality and security?**

**Answer:**

* **SonarQube:** Static code analysis and code smells.
* **OWASP Dependency Check:** For known security vulnerabilities.
* **JUnit + Mockito:** Unit and integration testing.
* **Checkstyle / PMD:** Code formatting and linting.
* **Git Hooks:** To enforce checks before commit.

---

### ‚úÖ 26. **How do you handle authentication and authorization (Auth vs Authz)?**

**Answer:**

* **Authentication** is verifying *who* the user is (we use **JWT tokens**).
* **Authorization** is verifying *what* the user can do (role-based access).
  In our project, after successful login, we issue a JWT token. That token is verified on every request using Spring Security. Based on the user role, access to APIs is controlled using annotations like `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`.
