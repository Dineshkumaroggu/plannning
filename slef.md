Awesome! Based on your resume, you're well-positioned for an HR round. Since HR rounds are generally more about evaluating **communication, attitude, culture fit, and motivation**, here’s a **custom prep guide** to help you shine:

---

### ✅ **1. Tell me about yourself**

Craft a strong 1–2 minute answer:

> “Hi, I’m Dinesh Kumar Reddy Oggu, a software developer with 3 years of experience specializing in Java backend development in the banking domain. I’ve built scalable apps using Spring Boot and Spring Batch, and I’ve automated many operations using Python and Perl scripts. I currently work at Mphasis on the Charles Schwab project and also enjoy building full-stack projects using React, Node.js, and Firebase. I’m passionate about tech, automation, and delivering high-quality, production-ready solutions.”

---

### ✅ **2. Why are you looking for a change?**

> “I’ve had a great learning experience at Mphasis. I’m now looking for a new challenge where I can contribute to larger-scale systems, grow in areas like system design and machine learning, and be part of a team that encourages innovation and full-stack ownership.”

---

### ✅ **3. Strengths**

* Strong backend development using Java + Spring Boot
* Problem-solving with DS & Algos
* Automating tasks (Python/Perl)
* Fast learner (projects in ML, AI, React, Firebase)

### ✅ **4. Weakness**

> “Earlier in my career, I was hesitant to speak up during technical discussions, but I’ve worked on that by actively participating in team reviews and cross-functional meetings.”

---

### ✅ **5. Why should we hire you?**

### ✅ **6. What are your salary expectations?**

(If it comes up)

### ✅ **9. Tell me about a challenging situation**

> “During a release, a critical Spring Batch job was failing due to a data inconsistency issue. I quickly debugged, wrote a fix, tested it, and coordinated a hotfix deployment. It avoided financial miscalculations for downstream systems and received appreciation from the client.”
